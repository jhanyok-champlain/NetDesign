enable and config t to go between modes
To create a vlan:
#config t
#vlan *
(vlan)# 'name of vlan

Setting access and trunk ports on switch:
#(config)interface range FastEthernet 0/x-y (let's you configure multiple ports at one time)
3(config-if-range)switchport access vlan x (defines the vlan for all ports in the range)

Configure interfaces in "ranges":
(config)ip routing (turns on routing on multilayer switches)
(config)interface vlan 100 (brings you into vlan interface config mode)
(config-if)ip address 10.25.100.1 255.255.255.0 (set the ip address of 10.25.100.1 for vlan 100 on a routing switch)
NOTE: This only needs to be set on the router-switch acting as the gateway for the vlan
