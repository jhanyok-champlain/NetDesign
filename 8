To do this - some additional work needs to be done on BTV Router
Set default route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to 192.168.2.1 (ISP) 
Use "default-information originate" in OSPF config to send default route to other routers in the area
Use "redistribute ospf 1" in BGP config to advertise all of the Foster 202 Co routes
OSPF for routing within Foster 202 Co
BGP routing for ISPs, Partner, Customer and external Foster 202
Define router instance
router bgp AS_Number_for_Router
Identify peers 
(config-router) neighbor ip_of_peer remote-as as-number_of_peer
Advertise Networks within that AS
Example: (config-router) network 10.10.52.0 mask 255.255.255.0
192.168.1.0/30 is in AS 1010
192.168.3.0/30 and 192.168.4.0/30 are in AS 2054
Other than the default route on BTV router, no static routes should be used
